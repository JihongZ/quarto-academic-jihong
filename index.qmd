I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the school of social science, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My main duty is data analysis using advanced statistical modeling such as machine learning, Bayesian network etc. My doctoral training was in the Educational Measurement and Statistics (EMS) program at University of Iowa mainly focusing on Bayesian latent variable modeling, Item response theory modeling.

My research tries to help other practitioners understand their data and correctly interpret, and to wisely use the powerful tools of statistics.
