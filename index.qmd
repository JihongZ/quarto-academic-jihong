## About me

Jihong Zhang is a postdoctoral fellow in the school of social science, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He likes to play with advanced statistical modeling such as machine learning, Bayesian network etc. His doctoral training was about Educational Measurement and Statistics (EMS) program at University of Iowa, where he mainly focused on Bayesian latent variable modeling, Item response theory modeling, and other psychometric modeling.
