## Quiz: What is Bayesian?

1.  [How to Pronounce Bayesian (Real Life Examples!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e38NuBFqaQ)
    -   "B-Asian" or "Bayes-ian"?
2.  [Frequentist vs Bayesian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNeo7FNlOyY)
    -   Example: In U.S., more Male Asian Faculty or Female Asian Faculty?
        -   Frequentist: If "Male:Female = 1:1 out of Asian Faculty" is fixed, how is the probability that the data happens?
        -   Bayesian: If I believe Male:Female = 1:2 but the data says 1:1, to what degree I need to update my mind?

## Bayesian Model Components

1.  What we see: Observed Data
2.  What we cannot see: Future Data, Data yet to be collected, Parameters

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Takehome Note I: Everything is random in Bayesian!**

-   Observed Data: Some **random** information given a unknown generation process
-   Parameter: The **random** components controlling the generation process

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Takehome Note II: Every random component can be expressed as probability!**

-   The probability of observed data given parameters: $p(\text{Observed Data}|\text{Parameters})$ = **Likelihood**
-   The probability of parameters: $p(\text{Parameters})$ = **Prior Distribution**
-   The probability of parameters given observed data: $p(\text{Parameters}|\text{Observed Data})$ = **Posterior Distribution**\*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A Bayesian thinking process:

I originally thought the ratio of male Asian faculty to female is about 1:2 (**Prior**). But the data we sampled from 1000 faculties says it is 1:1 (**Data; Likelihood give the true ratio we don't know**). Then I update my belief as the ratio is probably 1:1.5 (**Posterior**) after augmenting these two statements.

## Bayesian Analysis: Why It Is Used?

There are at least four main reasons why people use Bayesian Analysis:

1.  Missing data
    -   Multiple imputation
    -   More complicated model for certain types of missing data
2.  Lack of software capable of handing large sized analyses
    -   Have a zero-inflated Poisson model with 1000 observations and 1000 parameters? No problem in Bayesian!

## Bayesian Analysis: Why It Is Used? (Cont.)

3.  New complex models not available in frequentist framework
    -   Have a new model? (A model that estimates the probability students choose the right answers then choose the wrong answers in a multiple choice test?)
4.  Enjoy the Bayesian thinking process
    -   It is a way of thinking that everything is random and everything can be expressed as probability. It is a way of thinking that we can update our belief as we collect more data. It is a way of thinking that we can use our prior knowledge to help us understand the data.

## Bayesian Analysis: Issues

1.  subjective vs. objective
    -   Prior distribution is subjective. It is based on your prior knowledge.
    -   However, 1) Scientific judgement is always subjective 2) you can use objective prior distribution to avoid this issue.
2.  Computationally intensive
    -   It is not a problem anymore. We have computers.
3.  Difficult to understand

## Next Class

We will talk about how Bayesian methods works in a little bit more technical way.
