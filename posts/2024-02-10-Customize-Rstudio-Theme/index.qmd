> Visual model of quarto and rmarkdown is very easy to use. Though users can change font family for Source mode in Rstudio by `Options` menu, there is no direct way change font family for Visual model. However, by customizing the rstudio theme file—".rstheme", users can change font size/family/margin of Visual mode.

First of all, users can install some customized rstudio themes from github. For example, following guidelines [here](https://github.com/lusignan/RStudio-Material-Theme).

Second, on Mac, copy one .rstheme file (\~/.config/rstudio/themes) and rename it to your customized file (in my case, `jihongMaterials.rstheme`).

``` {.bash .bash echo="fenced"}
➜  rstudio ls   
dictionaries       rstudio-prefs.json themes
➜  rstudio cd themes 
➜  themes ls
material-lighter.rstheme   material-palenight.rstheme material.rstheme
➜  themes cp material.rstheme jihongMaterial.rstheme
➜  themes code jihongMaterial.rstheme        
```

Third, open up the `.rstheme` file and add the following code in the beginning of the file:

``` {.css filename="jihongMaterial.rstheme"}
/* rs-theme-name: jihongMaterial */
/* rs-theme-is-dark: TRUE */

.pm-proportional-font {
  font-family: "Apple SD Gothic Neo", serif !important;
  font-size: 16pt !important;
}

.pm-editing-root-node {
    padding-left: calc((100% - 1300px)/2) !important;
    padding-right: calc((100% - 1300px)/2) !important;
}
```

Note that .pm-proportional-font controls the font in Visual model. Users can change the font family/size just like CSS file.

Now, restart your Rstudio, select your theme from \`Global Options\`. You should find the user-specified font family in your Visual Model

Here is the my customized file: [jihongMaterial.rstheme](./jihongMaterial.rstheme)
